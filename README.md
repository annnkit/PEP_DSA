## About
This repository is a collection of my solutions to DSA problems. My goal is to:
- Improve my problem-solving skills.
- Understand core data structures and algorithms.
- Prepare for technical interviews.
- Track my progress over time.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **/problems**: Contains folders for each platform (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces).
  - Each problem has its own folder with the solution code and a brief explanation.
- **/notes**: Contains notes on key DSA concepts and techniques.
- **/resources**: A list of helpful resources for learning DSA.

## Languages Used
- C++
